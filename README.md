<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
As we know a lot of trading happens on the basis of technical and fundamental analysis.
Moving averages uses the past data to smoothen the price curve.
Most of traders used Moving average method for buying and selling shares
For this project we need to use 20 day and 50 day moving averages.

<h2> Golden Cross and death Cross</h2>
When the shorter-term moving average crosses above the longer-term moving average, it is a signal to BUY, as it indicates that the trend is shifting up. This is known as a Golden Cross.
When the shorter term moving average crosses below the longer term moving average, it is a signal to SELL, as it indicates the trend is shifting down. It is sometimes referred to as the Death Cross.
Moving averages cross each other in order to generate a signal.
When the signal is neither buy nor sell, it is classified as hold. If you already own the stock, keep it and if you don't then don't buy it now.

<h2>Data sets</h2>
The dataset provided here has been extracted from the NSE website.
The Stock price data provided is from 1-Jan-2015 to 31-July-2018 for six stocks Eicher Motors, Hero, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors, Infosys and TCS.

<h2>Results</h2>
Created a User defined function, that takes the date as input and returns the signal for that particular day (Buy/Sell/Hold) for all stocks!
The signal of sell and buy for that particular day is generated by subtracting the previous day's flag value. Flag value is generated using short-term and long-term moving averages.!
